# Contributing Guidelines 

Here are some guidelines and instructions for contributing to our projects. Please go through them before making a contribution. 

## Code of conduct 
KUOSC governs its participants according to the Contributor Convenant Code of Conduct. Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct(https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is a code of conduct for Open Source communities. As a contributor, you agree to follow this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <contact@kuosc.org.np>. 

## How to Contribute Code? 
Bug fixes, performance improvements, code formatting,... There are a lot of ways in which you can contribute code! The issues list of a project is a great place to find something that you can help us with.

To increase the chances of your code getting merged, please ensure that:
- You satisfy our contribution criteria.
- Your code follows our coding guidelines.
- Your code's documentation follows our rules.
- Your pull request:
- Passes all checks and has no conflicts.
- Has a well-written title and message that briefly explains your proposed changes.
 
Lastly, sign all your commits with a line like this: 
Signed-off-by": Your Name <Your@email.com> 

This shows that you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin(DCO). It certifies that you wrote or have the right to submit the project. 

## How to Report Bugs, Provide Feedback or Request Features?

We welcome all kinds of bug reports, user feedback, and feature requests.
Please report any issues to "new issue" in the relevant project's repository.

# How to Review and Contribute to Documentation?
 We value clear and comprehensive documentation as it plays a vital role in guiding contributors, providing usage instructions, and ensuring the long-term maintenance of our projects. Almost all of our codebases include documentation files in Markdown format (.md). 
If you want to review the documentation, you can find the documentation for each project within its repository. Look for files with the ".md" extension, which indicates they are written in Markdown format. If you find any areas that can be enhanced, We gladly encourage you to contribute.

# Are There Other Ways of Contributing?
Yes, there are a lot of other ways in which you can help us! 
You can organize workshops/events, answer user questions, and help us in administration, fundraising, website development, and communication/outreach.
If there's some other way, not listed above, in which you'd like to help, then please contact us at <contact@kuosc.org.np>. We will get in touch with you!
